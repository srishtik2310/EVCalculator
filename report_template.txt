EV Motor Requirement Report with battery requirements.

Motor Rating:
    Considering Weight kg max weight of the vehicle,

    Vm  = Max_speed m/s
    radius of wheel (r) = Radius m
    Angular velocity (ω) = V/r = Angular_velocity rad/s = Wheel_rpm rpm.
    Before trans-axle reduction, RPM of motor = Motor_rpm rpm.

    Total Force = Force for linear acceleration + Force to overcome rolling resistance +
                            Force to overcome gradient + Force to overcome aerodynamic drag

    Force for linear acceleration = Fl = m*a = Linear_acc_force N

    Force to overcome rolling resistance = Fr = μr*N = Rolling_resistance_force N
    Force to overcome gradient = Fg = m*g*sin(θ) = Gradient_force N.
    Force to overcome aerodynamic frag = Fa = Cd * A * 0.5 * r * Vm2 = Aerodynamic_force N

    Max Total Force = Ft = Fl + Fr + Fg + Fa = Total_force_max N

    Torque required = Ft * (radius of wheel) = Total_torque_max Nm
    After the gear reduction and considering efficiency of gear box,
    Torque required at the motor shaft = Motor_torque_max Nm.

    Total force (excluding gradient) = Total_force_min N
    Torque required = Total_torque_min Nm
    After the gear reduction,
    Torque required at the motor shaft = Motor_torque_min Nm.


    Rating of the motor:

    Power Rating:
    Max Power rating of motor required   =  Motor_power_max W
    Min Power rating of motor required =  Motor_power_min W

    Torque Rating:
    Max Torque rating of motor required = Motor_torque_max Nm
    Min Torque rating of motor required  = Motor_torque_min Nm

    Speed Rating:

    Max RPM of motor required = Motor_rpm rpm.
